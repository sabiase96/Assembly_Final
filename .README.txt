/**************************
* 	INTRO
**************************/
This is my final project that I completed for my Computer Assembly &
Organizations (CISP2410) class at Columbia State. It's a simple game where you
delve into a dungeon to avoid traps, fight monsters, and defeat a
final boss.

This program run on the NIOS II DE-10 Lite computer which can be used here: 

https://cpulator.01xz.net/?sys=nios-de10-lite

Upon starting the game, you will be presented with a graphic
and a prompt to press button 0 to start the game. Once you
release button 0, the game will start.

/**************************
*     MOVEMENT
**************************/
You will begin in room 1, which is an empty room. You will be 
able to navigate rooms by using switches 0 - 3 for their 
corresponding directions. If there is not a room in the direction 
you have selected, the game will tell you there is a wall there 
and then prompt you to select a new direciton.


/**************************
* 	ROOMS
**************************/
There are 4 different rooms that you can encounter in this game:

	- There is the empty room, which holds nothing within it.
	
	- A skeleton room, which holds a skeleton within that you must 
		defeat before being allowed to continue.
		
	- A trap room, which deals 3 points of damage to the player's 
		health bar.
		
	- The boss room, which holds the boss that the player must 
		defeat to win the game.
		
Rooms are continuous, so if you move into a trap room, trigger
the trap, move to a different room, and back track to the trap room,
you will take another 3 points of damage because the trap is still
active. The same rule applies to skeleton rooms.


/**************************
*     FINAL BOSS
**************************/
The final boss has three unique abilities as well as a passive aura
that surrounds the player. The aura deals 1 point of health damage 
every turn of combat. So, the player is under constant pressure to 
finish the fight before they run out of health.

The boss' three abilities are:

	- A damaging spell. The boss will begin casting a spell which
		will do heavy damage to the player if it is not avoided.
		
	- A barrier. The boss will surround himself in a barrier that
		protects him from any incoming damage. It also deals damage
		to any would be attackers.
	
	- A heal. The boss will beging casting a healing spell which
		completely restores his health to full if not interupted.
